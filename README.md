## My process
1. Create the Necessary Components and add HTML semantic structure first
2. Create the mobile rules first as the default rules and then the desktop rules second using Tailwind CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS default properties with a few custom properties
- JavaScript Function
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Here are the things that i learn:
1. Learn how to use Tailwind CSS
2. Remembering the Basic of React

### Continued development

I would like to continue develop my skill as a whole through projects from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
